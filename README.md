# SGE Job & Log Summarisation scripts

These scripts provide a simple interface to summarising the status of multiple jobs running through the [SGE grid system](https://arc.liv.ac.uk/trac/SGE).


* `qsjobs` is a wrapper around the `--xml` optupt generated by `qstat` to provide more intuitive output.
* `qslogs` is a wrapper script to view multiple [qsubsec](https://github.com/alastair-droop/qsubsec) log files.

## Installation

Installation should be as simple as:

~~~bash
git clone https://github.com/alastair-droop/qstools.git
cd qstools
python setup.py install
~~~

You will need python3 (>=3.3) to use these scripts.

If you do not have admin privileges, you can install this locally using `python setup.py install --user`.

After installation, you can verify that you have the correct version using `qsubsec -v`.

Although `qsubsec` can be run on most machines, the qsub executable must be available and functional for automatic qsub submission to work (using the `-s` argument with the qsub format).
